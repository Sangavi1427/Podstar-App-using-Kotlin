 
Version 5.4.2 brings several changes:

* likely fixed crash issue when the app is restarted after long idle
* fixed null pointer crash issue in when trying to report player error
* fixed null pointer crash issue when open player detailed view with online episode
* likely fixed the audio break issue when streaming some podcasts, particularly those related to "iHeart" (actually the server has some invalid settings, someone should notify them).
this should take effect with episodes in both subscribed or online feeds
