 Version 6.5.3 brings several changes:

* properly assigning ids to remote episodes in OnlineFeedView to resolve the issue of duplicates
* fixed possible startup hang when previous media was Youtube media
* the fixed for random starts in 6.4.0 conflicts with notification play/pause button, narrowed handling to only KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP
* some fragment class restructuring
