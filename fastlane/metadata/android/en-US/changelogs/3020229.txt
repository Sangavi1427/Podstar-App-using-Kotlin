 Version 6.3.5 brings several changes:

* added more Log.d statements in hope for tracking down the mysterious random playing
* FeedSettings view is all in Jetpack Compose, FeedSettingsPreferenceFragment removed
* in FeedSettings, added "Audo add new to queue" (accissible when associated queue not set to "None")
	* when set, new episodes during refresh will be added to the associated queue, regardless of being downloaded
* use adaptive date formats (stripped time) in Subscriptions view
