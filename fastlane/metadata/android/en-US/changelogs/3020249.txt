 Version 6.6.4:

* added ability to receive music or playlist shared from YT Music

* in newly subscribed Youtube channel or playlist, prefStreamOverDownload is set to true
* ensured virtual queue (continuous streaming) for previously subscribed "Youtube" type feed when the associated queue is set to None
* the max number of media is dropped to 60 on subscribing a Youtube type feed (higher number may cause delay or even failure due to network issues, will investigate other ways to handle)
