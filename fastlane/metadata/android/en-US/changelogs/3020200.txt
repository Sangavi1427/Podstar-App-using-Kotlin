 
Version 6.0.0 brings several changes:

## 6.0.0

* complete overhaul of database and routines, ditched the iron-age celebrity SQLite and entrusted the modern object-based Realm
* export/import DB is supported for the Realm DB with file extension .realm
* DB from Podcini version 5 and below can not be imported, see migrationTo6.md file on github for instructions
* deleting feeds is performed promptly
* components rely more on objects for communication, unnecessary DB access is reduced
* subscriptions sorting is more explicit
* in Subscriptions view, click on cover image of a feed opens the FeedInfo view (not FeedEpisodes view)
* in Subscriptions and episodes list views, corrected the issue of wrong images of episodes being shown when scrolling
* the Counter and its seetings are removed
* flow event additions and improvements
* receiving flow events are strictly tied to life cycles of the components
* NavDrawer no longer gets updated in the background but only upon open
* player control UI is more efficient
* PlaybackController is further enhanced for multiple access
* non-essential instantiations of PlaybackController are stripped
* AudioPlayer view is hidden when there is no media set to play
* playback routines are extensively tuned and cleaned, less layered
* in any episode list views, swipe with NO_ACTION defined pops up the swipe config dialog
* episodes marked played will be removed from all queues
* in EpisodeInfo view, "mark played/unplayed", "add to/remove from queue", and "favoraite/unfovorite" are at the action bar
* decade-old joanzapata iconify is replaced with mikepenz iconics
* removed the need for support libraries and the need for the jetifier
* Java tools checkstyle and spotbus are removed
* the clumsy FeedDrawerItem class was removed and related compponents are based purely on feed objects
* FeedInfo view has button showing number of episodes to open the FeedEpisodes view
* on action bar of FeedEpisodes view there is a direct access to Queue
* tidied up the header of FeedEpisodes view
* media size is shown on episode info view
* net-fetching of media size for not-downloaded media is removed for episode list views
* there is a setting to disable/enable auto backup OPML files to Google
* all RxJava code was replaced with coroutines, RxJava dependency is kept only for using fyyd search
* PlaybackPreferences using SharePreferences was removed and related info is handled by the DB as CurrentState
* InTheatre object is now the center reference for all currently playing stuff including the current play queue
* 5 queues are provided by default: Default queue, and Queues 1-4
	* all queue operations are on the curQueue, which can be set in all episodes list views
	* on app startup, the most recently updated queue is set to curQueue
* extensive adjustments project class structures
