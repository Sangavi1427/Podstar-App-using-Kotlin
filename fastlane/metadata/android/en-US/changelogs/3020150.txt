 
Version 5.5.0 brings several changes:

* likely fixed Nextcloud Gpoddersync fails
* fixed text not accepted issue in "add podcast using rss feed"
* removed kotlin-stdlib dependency to improve build speed
* cleaned out the commented-out RxJava code
* added export/import of episode progress for migration to future versions. the exported content is the same as with instant sync: all the play progress of episodes (completed or not)
* this is likely the last release of Podcini 5, sauf perhaps any minor bugfixes.
* the next Podcini overhauls the entire DB routines, SQLite is replaced with the object-based Realm, and is not compatible with version 5 and below.
