 
Version 6.3.4 brings several changes:

* fixed mis-behavior of setting associated queue to Active in FeedSettings
* items on dialog for "Auto delete episodes" are changed to checkbox
* playState Int variables have been put into enum PlayState
* corrected an error in incomplete reconsile
* fixed the nasty mis-behavior in Queues view when removing episodes
* updated feed in FeedInfo view when feed preferences change
* enhanced feed setting UI, added display of current queue preference
* added "prefer streaming over download" in feed setting. ruling along the global setting, streaming is preferred when either one is set to true
* added None in associated queue setting of any feed
	* if set, episodes in the feed are not automatically added to any queue, but are used as a natural queue for getting the next episode to play
	* the next episode is determined in such a way:
		* if the currently playing episode had been (manually) added to the active queue, then it's the next in queue
		* else if "prefer streaming" is set, it's the next unplayed episode in the feed episodes list based on the current sort order
		* else it's the next downloaded unplayed episode
