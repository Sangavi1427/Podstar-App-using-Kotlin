 
Version 4.2.2 brings several changes:

* bug fix on auto-download mistakenly set in 4.2.1
* Sorry for another change in click operation
 	* long-press on an icon would be the same as a click
	* click on title area allows operation on the single item
	* long-press on title area would allow for multi-select
