 Version 6.5.6 brings several changes:

* in feed preferences, the setting "play audio only" for video feed is replaced with the setting of a video mode.  If you set the previous setting, you need to redo with the new setting.
* added some extra permission requests when exporting/importing various files, maybe needed in some system
* re-enabed use of http traffic to work with relevant podcasts
