 Version 6.13.0

* updates playback position adaptively (in app and in widget) in an interval being the longer of 5 seconds and 2 percent of the media duration
	* this can be enabled/disabled in Settings->Playback->"Update progress adaptively", default to true
	* unadaptive interval, same as the previous, is 2 seconds
* added volume adaptation control to player detailed view to set for current media and it takes precedence over that in feed settings
* added a few new actions to swipe, bring it essentially equivalent to multi-select menus
* added auto-download policy: "Marked as Soon"
* when deleting media file, set the playState to Skipped only if the current state is lower than Skipped
* avoided the snack message "can't delete file ..." after streaming an episode
* fixed (again, sorry) the action button not updating issue after download in episodes lists
* tuned the AudioPlayer fragment
