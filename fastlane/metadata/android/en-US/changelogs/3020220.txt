 
Version 6.1.6 brings several changes:

* enabled swipe actions in Queue bin view (same actions as in Queue)
* both icons of show bin and back to queue are changed to be more intuitive
* bin items are sorted based on the update time
* added a reconsile feature in Downloads view that verifies episodes' download status with media files in system and performs cleanup
* likely fixed syncing with nextcloud and gpoddernet servers.
