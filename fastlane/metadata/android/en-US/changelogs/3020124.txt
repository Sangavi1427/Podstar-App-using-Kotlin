 
Version 4.5.4 brings several changes:

* fixed crash bug when setting fallback or fast-forward speeds with some Locales
* further enlarged height of the bottom player control to improve on missing pixels at the bottom
* on speed setting dialog, only tap on a preset chip sets the speed, only selected options will be set
* corrected the handling of current audio speed:
	* when speed for current audio is not set, podcast speed takes precedence
	* when speed for current audio is set, it takes precedence for the current audio (episode), even with pause/re-play
