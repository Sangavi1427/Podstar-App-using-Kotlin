 Version 6.5.9 brings several changes:

* partially fixed an issue seen on Samsung Android 14 device where after playing the user-started episode, subsequent episode in the queue is not played in foreground service and there is not notification panel and can get stopped by the system.
	* the current fix is though the subsequent episodes are still played without notification, the play is not stopped by the system.
* if videoMode of a feed is set to "audio only",
	* press on icon in the player UI will expand the player detailed view (rather than video view)
	* "show video" on the menu of AudioPlayer view is hidden
* some class restructuring
