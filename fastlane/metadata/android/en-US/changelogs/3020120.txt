 
Version 4.5.0 brings several changes:

* fixed bug of sort order not stable in feed item list
* in Subscriptions view added sorting of "Unread publication date"
* added preference "Fast Forward Speed" under "Playback" in settings with default value of 0.0, dialog allows setting a float number (capped between 0.0 and 10.0)
* added preference "Fallback Speed" under "Playback" in settings with default value of 0.0, dialog allows setting a float number (capped between 0.0 and 1.5)
* added new ways to manipulate play speed
* the "Skip to next episode" button
	* long-press moves to the next episode
	* by default, single tap does nothing
	* if the user customize "Fast Forward Speed" to a value greater than 0.1, it behaves in the following way:
		* single tap during play, the set speed is used to play the current audio
		* single tap again, the original play speed resumes
		* single tap not during play has no effect
* the Play button
	* by default, it behaves the same as usual
	* if the user customize "Fallback speed" to a value greater than 0.1, long-press the button during play enters the fallback mode and plays at the set fallback speed, single tap exits the fallback mode
