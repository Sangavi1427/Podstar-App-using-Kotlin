 
Version 4.6.0 brings several changes:

* added more info in online feed view
* added ability to open podcast from web address, reduced the error of "The podcast host\'s server sent a website, not a podcast"
* allows importing podcast from a web address, either through copy/paste or share.
* Youtube channels are accepted from external share or paste of address in podcast search view, and can be subscribed as a normal podcast. A channel is handled as a podcast feed, and videos in the channel are as episodes. Drawbacks now are playing of the video is not handled inside Podcini, but in Youtube app or the browser, and the play speed is not controlled by Podcini.
