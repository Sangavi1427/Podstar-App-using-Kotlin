 
Version 4.9.5 brings several changes:

* added action bar option in episode home view to switch on/off JavaScript
* added share notes menu item in reader mode of episode home view
* TTS speed uses playback speed of the feed or 1.0
* on player detailed view, if showing episode home reader content, then "share notes" shares the reader content
* fixed bug of not re-playing a finished episode
* fixed (possibly) bug of marking multiple items played when one is finished playing
