* in FeedSetting, fixed issue of auto-download options being enabled even if auto-download is not enabled
* "Put in queue" changed to "Add to queue..." and added checkbox for removing from other queues
* refined some handling on events
* fixed issue of deleted episodes not being correctly handled in some lists
* fixed issue of current media kept being played when removed or when removed from queue
* in FeedEpisodes view, fixed (mostly) issue of not being promptly filtered when an episode state changes
* when screen is turned back on during playback, PlayerUI is promptly updated
